Seattleites love their dogs. I created this app to help loving pet parents find restaurants that allow dogs either on the patio or inside, so they don't have to choose between a date with their friends, or a date with their dog.

Doggy Dates was my first portfolio piece for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. It is a responsive web app that was built using Javascript, JQuery, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Node.js, CSS and HTML using the Yelp API.
