Seattleites love their dogs. I created this app to help loving pet parents find restaurants that allow dogs either on the patio or inside, so they don't have to choose between a date with their friends, or a date with their dog.

Doggy Dates was my first portfolio piece for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. It was built using Javascript, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Node.js, CSS and HTML, and uses the Yelp API.
